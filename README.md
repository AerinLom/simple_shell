SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT:

-> The goal is to collectively program a UNIX based shell that executes various commands based on linux.

PROJECT IN-DEPTH:

-> Our custom shell should be able to run fundamental system commands, in order to achieve this we have to collectively create functions that will execute each command successfully. Our shell should be able to initialize by displaying a "$", display and execute user input, handle errors if the user does not execute a command correctly and print a current environment.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE:

-> windows 10, Ubuntu virtual machine, WSL 2 or ALX Webterm sandbox.

FILE EXECUTION:

-> After coding the appropriate functions, the files should be compiled using "gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh". If compilation is successful it should not return errors and "hsh" executable should initialize the shell.
